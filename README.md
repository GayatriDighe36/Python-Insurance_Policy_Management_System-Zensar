# Insurance Policy Management System  

The Insurance Policy Management System is a RESTful API designed to streamline the management of insurance policies, claims, payments, and client information. It is built using Pythonâ€™s core libraries and interacts with a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.  

## Features  
- Client Management: Store and manage client details.  
- Policy Management: Define and manage various insurance policies.  
- Claims Management: Record, update, and review client claims.  
- Payment Tracking: Manage premium payment records.  

## Project Highlights  
- Developed entirely using Python core libraries.  
- CRUD operations for each module.  
- Tested and verified using Postman.  
- MySQL database integration for reliable data storage.  

## Technology Stack
